## C programming.
More organized way to track my C programs.
Don't be scared if confused, because they can be badly written (just me making tests in order to understand the programing language or solve problems real quick). I'm trying to make them better.
One of the most common mistake people often make is do something over and over again without noticing it.
When one understands and codes something, one has to finely organize it for later use. Like code snippets.
This good practice saves our invaluable time and effort!
## C++ progrmaming
Understand ardupilot and later PX4.
OOP using C++ is hard and very useful skill to have.
C++ for embedded systems.
# Rules
+ Always document briefly new C project, what is it about and what are the references.
+ If cannot access this git repo, then temporarily working seperately on that C project and remember to integrate to this repo later.
